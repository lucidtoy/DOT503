I have followed the below steps on this project.

a) Implement Source control using Git and GitHub
1. Create a free GitHub account if you do not have one.
2. Create a simplistic application in your favourite programming language and push into
GitHub.
3. Create three branches from your repository named ‘feature-x’, ‘feature-y’, and ‘featurez’.
4. From each branch modify one of the source files so that they would lead to merge
conflicts.
5. Commit your changes in each branch and push each of the branches into GitHub.
6. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge ‘feature-x’ branch into the master branch and
approve the pull request.
7. From Git CLI, merge the updated master branch with ‘feature-y’ branch. Resolve the
conflict and push it into GitHub.
8. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge ‘feature-z’ branch into the master branch.
Resolve the conflict and complete the merge.
9. Commit your changes and push the master branch into GitHub.



Implement Unit testing
1. Create a branch named ‘unit-test’ and checkout the newly created branch.
2. In your chosen Unit testing framework, write five test cases for your applications such
that three test cases pass and two test cases fail. Modify your applications if required.
3. Add unit test files to your repository, commit the change and push the branch into
GitHub.
4. In GitHub, create a pull request to merge ‘unit-test’ branch with the master branch and
complete the merge.
